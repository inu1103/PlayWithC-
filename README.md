# PlayWithCPP
A Portfolio for simple application of C++ programming concepts.

Here are some of the programs, which gave some insights of the C++ concepts like functions, STL(Standard Template Libraries), Pointers, Array, LOOPs, etc.

1). TIC TAC TOE

-> It's a fun game, played between two players. 

-> Each player has his own mark to put on a 3*3 Square frame.

-> Both the players alternatively marks his mark, and finally who creates a sequence of 3, is marked as a Winner, else the game is a Draw.

-> IDE used :- CLion by JetBrains, C++11 and above.

2). FREQUENCY CALCULATOR 

-> How about you enter a large sequence of numbers, and you want to check how many numbers are occuring how many times.

-> This program performs your task. It not only checks for the repeatation of the number, but also gives the details of the occurence of each number, as well as the Highest occuring one, and the lowest occuring one.

-> This can be used further to check any duplicacy in the user input, and thus can benefit in different applications.

-> IDE used :- CLion by JetBrains, C++11 and above.

** Each folder, named with the above topic, contains an executable file named main.cpp. You can test the code by Build and Run.
